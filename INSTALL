Do the following:

  cat templates/bashrc.inject  >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc

Or simply:

  # this doesnt work so well: it install everything as ruby
  # so shell scripts are screwed.
  sudo gem install sakuric    # sakura was already taken :-(

Third chjoice (experimental):

  make install

Also remember that this package requires a few packages to work:

  make
  git
  ..
